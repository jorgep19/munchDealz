      <h1>What is Munch?</h1>
      <p>
        A new platform for posting and catching great food deals at local restaurants!
        Just another deals site you might think... but we are not! Munch has the mission
        of giving total control to restaurant owners and consumers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>For Customers: </strong>control how close (mile radius) a restaurant
        need to be in order to let you know about their deals. You can make exceptions
        for you favorite places to eat and by following them you will get special deals.
        Also, If its on Munch is valid! No more <i>"we can't take this coupon"</i>. The
        best part, search and redemption of deals are free!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>For Restaurant Owners: </strong> pay per posting; we don't want to put
        a tax on your income. Also, Munch helps you track the effect of your deals and
        allows you to modify them <i>on-the-run</i> to maximize the benefits for your
        business.
